# Community-Lead Expungement Assistance Repository

## Mission
Our mission is to facilitate individuals hoping to take the step towards fully reclaiming their future by getting their criminal records expunged.

## How We Plan To Do It
CLEAR intends to create a simple questionnaire to help individuals determine whether they are likely to be eligible for expungement of their criminal records.

Further, the project hopes to provide its api to other organizations or agencies.
